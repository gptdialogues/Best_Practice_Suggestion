Where is the best place to check the implementation of the C++ STL library?

The source code for the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) can typically be found in the implementation of the C++ Standard Library provided by your C++ compiler. Here are a few places you can look, depending on your compiler:

1. **GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)**: The GCC's C++ Standard Library is called libstdc++. You can find its source code on the [GCC's official website](https://gcc.gnu.org/) or its [mirror on GitHub](https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/tree/master/libstdc%2B%2B-v3).

2. **Clang (LLVM)**: Clang uses the LLVM project's libc++. Its source code can be found on the [LLVM's project website](https://llvm.org/) or its [repository on GitHub](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/tree/main/libcxx).

3. **Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC)**: MSVC's C++ Standard Library is called the Microsoft STL (MS STL). You can find its source code on [Microsoft's GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft/STL).

Remember that the C++ STL is not a simple library, but a part of the C++ Standard Library. It can be quite complex and reading its source code might be challenging. The source code is often optimized for performance and might use complicated programming techniques or rely on low-level details of the C++ language.

For learning about the STL and its usage, it's often better to refer to documentation or textbooks. Websites like [cppreference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/) provide excellent resources for understanding the functionality and usage of the C++ Standard Library, including the STL.
