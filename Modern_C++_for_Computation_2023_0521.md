Please tell me about modern C++ features which are useful for scientific high-performance computation with code examples.

There are numerous features in modern C++ (C++11 and beyond) that can be particularly useful for high-performance computation and scientific computing in particular. I'll describe a few, providing code examples for each.

**1. Auto Keyword:**

The `auto` keyword allows the compiler to determine the type of the variable at compile time. This can simplify code and make it more readable, particularly when dealing with complex data types. 

Example:

```cpp
std::vector<int> v = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

// Instead of writing the full type
for (std::vector<int>::iterator it = v.begin(); it != v.end(); ++it) {
    std::cout << *it << "\n";
}

// You can use auto
for (auto it = v.begin(); it != v.end(); ++it) {
    std::cout << *it << "\n";
}
```

**2. Range-Based For Loops:**

Range-based for loops simplify iterating over containers. This can make code easier to read and write.

Example:

```cpp
std::vector<int> v = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

// Instead of a traditional loop
for (size_t i = 0; i < v.size(); ++i) {
    std::cout << v[i] << "\n";
}

// You can use a range-based for loop
for (const auto& value : v) {
    std::cout << value << "\n";
}
```

**3. Lambda Functions:**

Lambda functions provide a simple way to define small, anonymous functions. They can be particularly useful in scientific computing when you want to pass small functions as parameters to other functions.

Example:

```cpp
std::vector<int> v = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

// Using a lambda function to add 2 to each value in the vector
std::transform(v.begin(), v.end(), v.begin(), [](int value) { return value + 2; });
```

**4. std::array and std::vector:**

Modern C++ provides std::array and std::vector as safer, more feature-rich alternatives to C-style arrays. std::array has fixed size while std::vector can grow dynamically.

Example:

```cpp
// Declare an array with size 5
std::array<int, 5> arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

// Declare a vector with initial size 5
std::vector<int> vec = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
```

**5. Move Semantics and Rvalue References:**

Move semantics and Rvalue references allow resources to be moved (rather than copied) when an object is to be modified, such as during a function return or when adding to a vector. This can dramatically improve performance for large objects.

Example:

```cpp
std::vector<std::string> v;
std::string str = "Hello World!";

// Instead of copying str
v.push_back(str); 

// You can move str into the vector
v.push_back(std::move(str));
```

Note that str should not be used after it has been moved from, as its state is now undefined.

**6. Threading:**

Modern C++ provides built-in support for threading, which can be useful for exploiting multicore processors in high-performance scientific computing applications.

Example:

```cpp
#include <thread>

// A simple function that does some work
void do_work() {
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
        std::cout << "Doing work\n";
    }
}

int main() {
    // Start a new thread that runs do_work
    std::thread worker(do_work);

    // Wait for the worker thread to finish
    worker.join();

    return 0;
}
```

**7. constexpr:**

The `constexpr` keyword allows the value of a function or variable to be computed at compile time. This can improve performance by precomputing values that would otherwise be computed at runtime.

Example:

```cpp
constexpr int square(int x) {
    return x * x;
}

int main() {
    const int val = square(10);  // This is computed at compile time
    std::cout << val << "\n";
}
```

Remember, the best features to use depend on the specific requirements of your code. It's always a good idea to benchmark different approaches to understand their performance implications.
