How do I automate the management of PC cluster with 10 PC nodes whose OS are Ubuntu Desktop?

Managing a cluster of PCs, regardless of size, typically involves tasks such as system updates, application installation and updates, system monitoring, and potentially task distribution and data sharing. Here is a broad overview of tools and strategies you could use to automate the management of a PC cluster running Ubuntu Desktop:

**1. Configuration Management:**

- **Ansible:** Ansible is an open-source tool that can automate software provisioning, configuration management, and application deployment. It uses a simple syntax written in YAML called playbooks. Ansible can help you ensure that each node in your cluster has the correct software installed and is correctly configured.
  
- **Puppet/Chef/SaltStack:** These are also popular tools for managing configurations at scale, though they tend to be more complex than Ansible. They can be useful if you need more advanced features.
  
**2. Software and Update Management:**

- **Unattended Upgrades:** Ubuntu includes a package called "unattended-upgrades" that can be configured to automatically install security updates. You could use this in combination with a configuration management tool to ensure that all nodes have this package installed and configured correctly.

- **APT package management via Ansible or other tools:** You can use your configuration management tool to ensure that specific packages are installed, removed or updated on all nodes.

**3. Remote Execution:**

- **Ansible:** In addition to configuration management, Ansible can also execute commands on a group of machines simultaneously. This is useful for tasks that need to be performed on all nodes, like restarting a service.

- **Fabric:** Fabric is a Python library and command-line tool for streamlining the use of SSH for application deployment or systems administration tasks.

**4. Monitoring:**

- **Prometheus and Grafana:** Prometheus is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit. It can collect metrics from your nodes, and Grafana can visualize those metrics. This can help you identify any issues with your nodes.

- **Nagios/Zabbix:** These are also popular open-source monitoring tools.

**5. Task Distribution/Cluster Management:**

- **Kubernetes:** If you're running services that can be containerized, Kubernetes is a platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications across a cluster of machines.

- **SLURM/PBS:** For HPC workloads, workload managers like SLURM or PBS can be used to distribute tasks among nodes.

In terms of general strategy, start by identifying the tasks that you find yourself performing most frequently. Then, find a tool that can automate those tasks, and start writing scripts or playbooks (in the case of Ansible) to automate them. Over time, you can gradually automate more and more tasks, reducing the amount of manual work required to manage your cluster.

Remember, it's important to ensure that all your automation scripts and configurations are backed up and version-controlled. Tools like git can help with this. It's also a good idea to have a testing or staging environment where you can test your automation scripts before deploying them to the production cluster.

Are there any merits to have a self-build PC cluster for research calculation?

Building a self-made PC cluster for research calculations can have several benefits depending on your specific requirements and constraints. Here are some potential merits:

**1. Customization:**

With a self-build PC cluster, you have complete control over the hardware and software configuration. You can tailor the system to the exact needs of your research. This includes choosing the CPU, GPU, memory, storage, and network hardware that best suits your calculation workloads. 

**2. Cost-effectiveness:**

Depending on your specific use case, building your own PC cluster can be more cost-effective than using commercial cloud services or buying a pre-built high-performance computing (HPC) system. For long-running, compute-intensive tasks, the cost of cloud services can add up. 

**3. Learning Experience:**

Building and managing a PC cluster can be a valuable learning experience. It can help you gain a deeper understanding of computer hardware, network configurations, and system administration. This can be beneficial not only for your current research but also for your future career.

**4. Data Privacy:**

If your research involves sensitive data, keeping the data on your own hardware might be a requirement. By building your own PC cluster, you can ensure the data never leaves your local network.

However, it's also important to consider the potential drawbacks. Building and maintaining a PC cluster requires a significant time investment and a broad set of skills, including hardware troubleshooting, OS administration, and potentially network administration. You also need to consider the costs of power, cooling, and maintenance, which can be substantial for a high-performance cluster. 

Furthermore, you won't have access to the same level of technical support and services that you would get from a commercial cloud provider or an HPC vendor. For example, if a hardware component fails, you will be responsible for diagnosing and fixing the problem yourself.

In conclusion, whether to build a self-made PC cluster depends largely on your specific needs, skills, and resources. It can be a good option in certain scenarios, but it's important to weigh the potential benefits against the costs and challenges.

How about merits to use PC clusters offered by universities or research institutes?

Utilizing PC clusters offered by universities or research institutes can have several significant advantages, especially for researchers who need high computing power but do not have the resources or expertise to build and maintain their own clusters. Here are some of the key benefits:

**1. Access to High-End Resources:**

University and research institutes often have high-performance computing (HPC) clusters with high-end CPUs, GPUs, and fast network connections. These resources can be prohibitively expensive to acquire for individual researchers or small research groups. By using the institution's resources, you get access to high-end computing power that can significantly speed up your computations.

**2. Technical Support and Maintenance:**

When you use a PC cluster provided by an institution, the technical support and maintenance are typically handled by a dedicated IT team. This means you don't have to worry about hardware failures, software updates, security patches, and other maintenance tasks. You also have a team to turn to when you encounter technical issues or need help optimizing your computations.

**3. Cost Savings:**

Using an institutional PC cluster usually comes at little or no cost to researchers within the institution. Even if there are usage fees, they're typically much less than the cost of building and maintaining a comparable private cluster or using commercial cloud services.

**4. Software Availability:**

Institutional clusters often come with a wide range of pre-installed software, including compilers, libraries, and applications relevant to various research fields. They may also have licenses for commercial software that would be expensive for individual researchers to purchase.

**5. Collaboration and Data Sharing:**

Institutional clusters usually have systems in place for sharing data and resources among researchers. This can make it easier to collaborate with colleagues and can facilitate interdisciplinary research.

**6. Training and Education:**

Many institutions provide training and educational resources to help researchers use their HPC resources effectively. This can be an excellent way to learn more about high-performance computing and parallel programming.

Of course, using an institutional PC cluster also has potential drawbacks. There may be usage limits or queues that restrict how much computing time you can use, and you may have less control over the system configuration than you would with a private cluster. However, for many researchers, the benefits outweigh these limitations.
