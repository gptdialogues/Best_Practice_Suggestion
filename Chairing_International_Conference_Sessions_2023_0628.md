Sure, being the chairperson for a session in an international conference is a significant responsibility. Here are some things that you should consider and prepare for:

1. **Understand the Conference and Session Theme:** Ensure you have a solid understanding of the overall theme of the conference and the specific focus of your session. This will allow you to guide discussions effectively and ask meaningful questions.

2. **Know Your Speakers:** Familiarize yourself with the speakers' background and their topics. This may involve reading their bios, reviewing their presentation abstracts, and understanding their work in the broader context of the session topic.

3. **Preparation:** Make sure you understand the conference timeline, and how your session fits within it. Confirm logistics such as the timing, location, technology, and format of your session. 

4. **Introductions:** Prepare to introduce each speaker with a brief summary of their background and their talk. Keep these introductions concise and relevant. 

5. **Time Management:** This is one of the most important tasks as a chair. Make sure each speaker begins and ends on time. Have a clear system for giving speakers a '5-minute warning' towards the end of their allotted time.

6. **Moderating Discussion:** Plan how you will handle the Q&A period. Some conferences prefer questions to be held until the end, while others encourage interaction throughout. 

7. **Setting the Tone:** As the chair, you'll help set the atmosphere of the session. Being professional, calm, and positive can help put your speakers at ease and foster a more engaging discussion.

8. **Handling Technical Issues:** Be prepared for possible technical glitches, especially in the case of virtual conferences. Make sure you know who to contact for immediate technical support.

9. **Protocol and Etiquette:** Understand the conference's protocol and cultural expectations, especially in an international setting. This could include knowing how to pronounce speaker's names correctly, understanding varying academic titles, and recognizing different customs around discourse and debate.

10. **Closing Remarks:** Prepare a brief conclusion for the session. This can include summarizing key points, thanking the speakers and the audience, and mentioning any follow-up events or sessions.

11. **Contingency Plan:** Have a plan in case a speaker doesn't show up, finishes early, or overruns their time. You might need to facilitate extra discussion, fill in with relevant content, or make changes to the schedule.

Remember, your role as a chairperson is critical to ensure a smooth session. So, prepare well, maintain poise, and manage time effectively.
